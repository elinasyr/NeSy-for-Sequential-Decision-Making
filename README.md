# NeSy-for-Sequential-Decision-Making

Sequential Decision Making (SDM) is the process used to solve Sequential Decision Processes (SDPs). Two main methods exist for solving SDPs: Automated Planning (AP) (Ghallab, Nau, and Traverso 2004) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton and Barto 2018). In recent years, a novel approach integrating AP and RL has gained significant attention. This hybrid approach, called Neurosymbolic AI (Besold et al. 2017), combines the deep neural networks commonly used in modern RL with the symbolic representations from Symbolic Planning, which is AP's form of knowledge representation.

This repository tracks literature and online resources on Neurosymbolic AI for reinforcement learning and broader sequential decision making problems. We will populate it with relevant papers and resources, providing short summaries for each. While we aim to be comprehensive, some works may be missing initially. Please feel free to create issues or suggest your own work for inclusion.

The idea of this repo was inspired by the amazing work [Awesome Transformers for Sequential Decision Making](https://github.com/hammer-wang/Awesome-Transformers-for-Sequential-Decision-Making?tab=readme-ov-file), which tracks relevant work on transformers for sequential decision making.
